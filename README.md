# Lyrics Data Vis project

### Getting Started

You'll need to download the SQLITE databases from http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/musixmatch
The following files should exist afterwards

* analyzer/mxm_dataset.db
* analyzer/track_metadata.db

Afterwards, you can add your own words to the `words` input and run the `analyzer/index.js` script to generate your own analysis.
